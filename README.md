JavaScript: The Advanced Concepts by Andrei Neagoie




You can't get good at MERN (or any Node.js centric stack) unless you're good at the native web stack. Getting good at both CSS and JavaScript are constantly evolving and are a lot to learn alone. And if you're going to use React, you gotta learn it's ins and outs, alongside React's (annoyingly growing) list of tooling, like Webpack. Then there's the (imo unnecessary) CSS frameworks...
I think you should focus on applying for front-end roles once you've gotten good with HTML, CSS (esp Flexbox and Grid), JavaScript (give the DOM manipulation, Promises, async/await, Fetch, Storage, intersection observer APIs a lot of attention), and {insert JS framework of the day + it's necessary tooling here}.
This is a lot to learn already.
My approach is/was learn
The native tech stack (I'm very confident with CSS, JS, JS APIs)
OOP with JS (heads up, React is a very anti-OOP ecosystem. Don't fall into that mindset)
Functional programming with JS
Some OOP design patterns (learning SOLID principles and design patterns turn my spaghetti code into very structured code, and in some occasions, over engineered code)
React (class syntax and functional hooks) + Webpack 5
CSS Modules (not to be confused with CSS Module scripts) for styling React components
Some React centric design patterns
Redux
React Router
Web Components (fucking awesome native browser component system. I choose it plus the Flux pattern over React every time I can)
The component centric pattern container/presentational pattern (great for structuring all types of components and it's associated code)
Flux pattern for highly structured, non-dependancy state management. I suggest ever Web Components and proprietary component library user to learn the Flux pattern. It made me understand Redux so much better.
Afterwards I built a few frontend applications via the native tech stack (Semantic HTML, CSS Flexbox + Grid, Web Components wrapped in some patterns), and rebuilt them via React + Redux. I def prefer the less overly complicated tooling centric native approach, but knowing a indemand framework is important. After some frontend projects, I learned Node.js + Express, routing via Express, AJV, MongoDB (I already know MySQL), the controller/ service/model architecture, JWT authentication, error handling, logging, testing, and deployment. Now I'm learning about distributed systems with Node.js while applying to front end roles and MERN roles.
